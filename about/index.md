## About the Podcast
<i>Two queer, trans, and polyamorous folks share how they have built their relationship over time, and how you can build yours, too.</i>
Queerly Yours is a podcast about the tender, complicated, and fascinating ways that people create and maintain their relationships with partners, friends, and family. Co-hosts Angela and Naomi discuss their own relationship histories and experiences, as well as drawing on perspectives, questions, and topic suggestions from their audience. You can submit your own questions and topic suggestions to the show's <a href="https://twitter.com/queerlyyourspod">twitter</a>, or by emailing the hosts at <queerlyyours@protonmail.com>.

## Meet the Co-Hosts

<b>Angela Lemus-Mogrovejo</b> is a trans Latina writer, poet, musician, and tabletop game streamer. She was an inaugural fellow in the 
<a href="https://rootedinrights.org/video/video-a-blessing-all-my-own/">Rooted in Rights</a> writing fellowship program, runs RPG streams for <a href="https://twitter.com/WelcomePartyRPG">Welcome to the Party</a>, and has contributed articles and poetry to publications including <a href="http://www.artforourselves.org/">Art for Ourselves</a>, <a href="https://rosequartzmagazine.wixsite.com/magazine">Rose Quartz Magazine</a>, and <a href="https://www.queerfutures.com/">Queer Futures Collective</a>. Her interest in podcasting springs in part from a longstanding love of voice acting and audio technique, and partly from an interest in sharing a creative project with Naomi. She co-hosts Queerly Yours, and is currently beginning the work of transcribing the episode archive.

<b>Naomi Bosch</b> is a white genderqueer educator and tabletop game designer. They have a background in sexual and relationship health education, as well as music tutoring and outdoor environmental education. As a teenager, one of their favorite pastimes was hanging out on the relationship advice sections of Yahoo Answers and answering other anxious teens’ queries about dating, boundaries, and whether or not they might be pregnant. Hosting a relationship podcast has felt like a natural development on their adolescent hobby, now bolstered by both further education and the joy of creatively collaborating with Angela. In addition to co-hosting Queerly Yours, they edit and produce the episodes and maintain the podcast website.
