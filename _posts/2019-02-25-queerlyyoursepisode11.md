In a special episode format, hosts Angela and Naomi posed a question to the Internet - what relationship advice do you wish you could give your teenage self? Join them as they sort through and reflect on a range of sweet, tender, funny, and intense answers that all of us can learn from. 

Content warning: this episode contains brief discussion of abusive relationships.

This episode also has a few audio glitches that couldn't be easily caught via editing without also cutting out a lot of wonderful quotes and conversation, so expect occasional short sections of audio with faint background fuzz, clicks, or thunks, and thank you for bearing with us!
