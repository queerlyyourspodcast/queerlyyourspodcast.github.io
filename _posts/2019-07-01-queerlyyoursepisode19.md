<p>Angela and Naomi discuss what bisexuality means to them personally as well as the ways that the term operates socially and culturally in their broader communities. They dig into bisexual stereotypes, terminology overlap, and how thereâ€™s no required timeline for developing an understanding of your sexuality or gender because compulsory heterosexuality is a huge mess for all of us.</p>
