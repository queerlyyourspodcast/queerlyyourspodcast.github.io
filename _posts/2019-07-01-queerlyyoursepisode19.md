<p>Angela and Naomi discuss what bisexuality means to them personally as well as the ways that the term operates socially and culturally in their broader communities. They dig into bisexual stereotypes, terminology overlap, and how there’s no required timeline for developing an understanding of your sexuality or gender because compulsory heterosexuality is a huge mess for all of us.</p>
<p>For a nice overview of some bisexual activist history in the U.S. along with links to other resources, check out <a href="https://www.autostraddle.com/weve-always-been-here-honoring-bisexual-history-imagining-bisexual-futures-308423/">this article</a> on Autostraddle.</p>
<p>For an analysis of the dangers that come with assuming that gender or sexuality are strictly categorizable and clearly identifiable concepts, read Os Keyes’ essay on data violence, <a href="https://reallifemag.com/counting-the-countless/">Counting the Countless</a>.</p>
<p>The RPG about romancing cryptids that Naomi mentions is called <a href="https://mercutioes.itch.io/mothman"><em>i kissed mothman behind the arby’s</em></a>.</p>
