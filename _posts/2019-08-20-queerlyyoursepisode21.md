<p>Angela and Naomi talk with <a href="https://twitter.com/theloveliestliz">Elizabeth Nordenholt</a>, co-host of the podcasts <a href="https://twitter.com/podcastYFIP">Your Fave is Problematic</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/FMKAllDayPod">FMK All Day</a>, about her personal journey around queerness and polyamory. The three dig into topics like purity culture, helpful books on polyamory, friend and family responses to non-normative relationships, and assumptions about dating and romance you might not realize you have until you try to change the format of a partnership.</p>
