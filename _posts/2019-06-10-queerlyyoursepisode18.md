<p>Naomi and Angela talk about Pride, exploring what it means to them and how it culturally operates as a protest, a parade, a philosophy, and more. Angela talks about how race and disability can affect experiences of and connections to Pride events. Naomi shares what they make sure to carry when attending big outdoor festivals, and suggests ways for allies/accomplices to show up for LGBTQ+ folks this month and every month.</p>
<p>(Two things the hosts definitely agree on are that <a href="https://www.bitchmedia.org/article/should-cops-be-allowed-at-pride">cops shouldn't be at Pride</a>, and that you should <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23transpizza&amp;src=typd">buy a trans person a pizza</a>.)</p>
