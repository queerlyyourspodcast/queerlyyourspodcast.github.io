Naomi and Angela are moving in together soon! To celebrate, they reflect on past shared living experiences (with each other and others) and discuss the key themes they've found helpful for fostering comfortable, communicative roommate dynamics.

Naomi recommends a couple of roommate resources during this episode: Captain Awkward's vast and varied archive of <a href="https://captainawkward.com/category/roommates/">roommate-related advice</a>, and the charming comic book <a href="https://ironcircus.com/product/poorcraft/">Poorcraft</a>, which has a section on housing as well as many other topics related to living on limited means.
