Naomi and Angela talk about some of their hobbies, both ones they share and ones they enjoy separately, and offer strategies for supporting your partner's hobbies while also being honest about your own level of interest (or lack thereof) in the things they enjoy. The hosts also discuss the concept of the "man cave" in more analytic depth than it probably deserves.
