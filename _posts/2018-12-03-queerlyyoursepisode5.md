Welcome to Trans Dating 201! The hosts don't pause for 101-level term definitions, and cisgender people are an auxiliary audience, though still a welcome one.
Angela and Naomi dig into what it's like to be in relationships as, and with, trans people, and how to manage connections with family and friends who have varying levels of experience and emotional competence in addressing trans topics. This is the first Queerly Yours episode based on an audience question, though "conceptually broad audience-suggested theme" might be more appropriate. Whatever it is, Naomi takes three solid minutes to articulate it at the beginning of the episode.
