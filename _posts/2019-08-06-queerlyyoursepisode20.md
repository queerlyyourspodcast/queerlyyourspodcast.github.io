<p>Naomi and Angela answer a listener question about how to balance dating with other major life commitments like work and school. What do you do when you want to make new connections with people but the process feels time consuming or overwhelming? The hosts discuss multi-purpose ways to socialize, the general exhaustion of life under capitalism, and why folks who worry about their dating inexperience might already have more relevant social skills than they realize.</p>
