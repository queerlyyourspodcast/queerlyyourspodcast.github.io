Join Naomi and Angela for a Valentine's Day special about sidestepping social norms, connecting genuinely with those you love, and figuring out what romance really means to you and your partner(s). If you're not sure how to talk about the ways that cultural expectations around Valentine's Day gifts, intimacy, and affection affect your relationship(s), this is a great episode for you. If you're not sure how you feel about romantic gestures or holidays in general, this is a great episode for you. If you are hyped about romance and want to dig deeper into what it means to you and others, this is also a great episode for you! Basically what we're saying is that it's a great episode for this, or any, season.
