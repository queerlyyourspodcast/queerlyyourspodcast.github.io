Angela and Naomi both love tabletop roleplaying games (RPGs)! In fact, they love them so much that they decided to make a whole episode about how relationship dynamics can operate in games, and how their philosophies around games and relationships interconnect and inform each other. The hosts journey into topics like game group dynamics, consent in nonsexual social situations, the role(s) of RPGs in queer and trans community building, and games as relationship metaphors.
